Film photography is the art of taking photographs on thin, transparent strips of plastic we call film. One side of the film strip is coated with a gelatin emulsion that contains small silver halide crystals, which determine the contrast and resolution of a photograph. Silver halide crystals are light-sensitive. The more light they’re exposed to, the brighter and less detailed the photograph will be. When a film camera takes a picture, the camera lens briefly exposes the film strip to an image that’s being magnified through the lens. This exposure burns an imprint into the emulsion and creates what’s called a latent image. Once captured, that latent image can be developed into a negative, which can, in turn, be projected onto light-sensitive photo paper to create a photograph.
